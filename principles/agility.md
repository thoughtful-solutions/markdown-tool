# P: Interoperability

## Definition

The ability to respond rapidly and effectively to changes in the business environment, customer expectations, or technological landscape.

## Rationale

To accelerate time-to-market for new products and features, gain a competitive advantage, and enable the business to pivot its strategy quickly without being constrained by rigid technology.


## Implications

* **Business**: Fosters an iterative approach to planning and funding that aligns with agile development cycles.
* **Application**: Favours building loosely coupled, independently deployable services (e.g., microservices) over monolithic applications.
* **Data**:  Requires flexible data schemas and databases that can evolve easily as application requirements change.
* **Technology**:  Depends heavily on cloud-native technologies, containerization, and mature CI/CD pipelines to automate the path to production.
  
## Metrics

* Deployment frequency (how often code is deployed to production).
* Lead time for changes (from code commit to production).
* Change failure rate (percentage of deployments causing a failure).
* Cycle time (from idea to delivered value).

## Implementation Guidelines

* Embrace a DevOps culture of collaboration and shared responsibility
* Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to create reproducible environments.
* Adopt architectural patterns like microservices and feature flags to reduce deployment risk.
* Implement comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).
