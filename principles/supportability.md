# P: Supportability

## Definition

The inherent quality of a system that enables it to be easily and cost-effectively operated, monitored, maintained, and managed throughout its entire lifecycle.

## Rationale

To lower the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), improve system reliability and availability, and increase the efficiency of IT operations and support teams.

## Implications

* **Business**: Requires clear service-level agreements (SLAs) and defined ownership for every business service.
* **Application**: Mandates the implementation of comprehensive logging, health checks, and performance monitoring to proactively identify and diagnose issues.
* **Data**: Involves designing data pipelines and storage systems that are easy to back up, restore, and troubleshoot
* **Technology**:  Necessitates the use of standardized, well-documented infrastructure components and centralized monitoring and alerting tools
  
## Metrics

* Mean Time To Detection (MTTD)
* Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).
* Number of manual support interventions required per month.
* Cost of support per application or service.

## Implementation Guidelines

* Enforce a standardized logging and metrics framework (e.g., OpenTelemetry) for all applications.
* IUtilize a centralized platform for log aggregation, monitoring, and alerting
* Automate deployment and configuration management using CI/CD pipelines and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Maintain comprehensive operational documentation ("runbooks") for all critical systems.
