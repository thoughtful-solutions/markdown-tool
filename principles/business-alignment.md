# P: Business Alignment

## Definition

The principle of ensuring that all architectural decisions are directly driven by and traceable to the enterprise's strategic goals, value streams, and business capabilities.

## Rationale

To maximize the business value of all IT investments, prevent the creation of technology for technology's sake, and ensure that the entire enterprise architecture is a cohesive tool for executing business strategy.

## Implications

* **Business**: Requires a well-defined business architecture that clearly articulates strategy, capabilities, and key processes to guide all other architectural domains.
* **Application**: Every application in the portfolio must be mapped to the business capabilities it supports, justifying its existence, cost, and future development.
* **Data**:  he enterprise data architecture must prioritize and model the data assets that are most critical to the business's value streams and decision-making processes.
* **Technology**:  All infrastructure and platform choices must be justified based on the functional and non-functional requirements derived from business needs, not just on technical merit.
  
## Metrics

* Percentage of IT budget allocated to strategic vs. operational initiatives.
* Traceability of technology projects back to specific business capabilities or goals.
* Business stakeholder satisfaction scores with IT solutions.

## Implementation Guidelines

* Establish a formal architecture governance process that includes business representation.
* Use the Business Capability Model as the primary lens for planning the application portfolio.
* Conduct regular reviews to ensure ongoing alignment between projects and business strategy.
* Translate business goals into clear architectural requirements before starting solution design.
