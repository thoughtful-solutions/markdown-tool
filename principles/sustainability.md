# P: Sustainability

## Definition

The practice of designing, building, and operating technology systems in a way that minimizes environmental impact, ensures social responsibility, and is economically viable over the long term.

## Rationale

To reduce operational costs through energy efficiency, meet regulatory and corporate social responsibility (CSR) goals, and enhance brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to environmental stewardship.

## Implications

* **Business**: Requires integrating sustainability goals into the business strategy and procurement processes.
* **Application**: Involves writing efficient code and designing algorithms that consume fewer CPU cycles and memory, reducing the overall processing power required.
* **Data**: Mandates data lifecycle management to eliminate redundant and obsolete data, thus reducing storage and backup energy consumption.
* **Technology**: Prioritizes the selection of energy-efficient hardware, consolidation of servers, and partnering with cloud providers that are committed to using renewable energy sources.

## Metrics

* Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) in data centres.
* Carbon footprint (tCO2e) of the IT landscape.
* Percentage of cloud workloads running on renewable energy.
* Hardware and e-waste disposal rates.

## Implementation Guidelines

* Adopt "Green Coding" principles and best practices.
* Implement auto-scaling and "scale-to-zero" policies for cloud resources.
* Establish a hardware refresh and disposal policy focused on reuse and recycling.
* Favour software-as-a-service (SaaS) and managed cloud services to leverage provider-scale efficiencies.
